## Abstract
Current top-performing object detectors depend on deep CNN backbones, such as ResNet-101 and Inception, benefiting from their powerful feature representations but suffering from high computational costs. Conversely, some lightweight model based detectors fulfil real time processing, while their accuracies are often criticized. In this paper, we explore an alternative to build a fast and accurate detector by strengthening lightweight features using a hand-crafted mechanism. Inspired by the structure of Receptive Fields (RFs) in human visual systems, we propose a novel RF Block (RFB) module, which takes the relationship between the size and eccentricity of RFs into account, to enhance the feature discriminability and robustness. We further assemble RFB to the top of SSD, constructing the RFB Net detector. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments are conducted on two major benchmarks and the results show that RFB Net is able to reach the performance of advanced very deep detectors while keeping the real-time speed.

目前性能最好的目标检测器依赖于深层的CNN主干，如ResNet-101和Inception，这得益于它们强大的特征表示，但计算成本较高。相反，一些基于轻量级模型的检测器实现了实时处理，而它们的准确性常常受到批评。在本文中，我们探索了一种替代方法，通过使用手工制作的机制增强轻量级功能来构建快速准确的探测器。受人类视觉系统中接收场(RF)结构的启发，我们提出了一种新的RF块(RFB)模块，该模块考虑了RF的大小和偏心率之间的关系，以增强特征的区分能力和稳健性。我们进一步将RFB组装到SSD顶部，构建RFB网络探测器。为了评估其有效性，在两个主要基准上进行了实验，结果表明，RFB-Net能够达到高级超深探测器的性能，同时保持实时速度。代码位于https://github.com/GOATmessi7/RFBNet .
