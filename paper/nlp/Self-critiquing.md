# Self-critiquing models for assisting human evaluators
辅助人类评估者的自我批评模型 2022.6.12 https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05802

## Abstract
We fine-tune large language models to write natural language critiques (natural language critical comments) using behavioral cloning. On a topic-based summarization task, critiques written by our models help humans find flaws in summaries that they would have otherwise missed. Our models help find naturally occurring flaws in both model and human written summaries, and intentional flaws in summaries written by humans to be deliberately misleading. We study scaling properties of critiquing with both topic-based summarization and synthetic tasks. Larger models write more helpful critiques, and on most tasks, are better at self-critiquing, despite having harder-to-critique outputs. Larger models can also integrate their own selfcritiques as feedback, refining their own summaries into better ones. Finally, we motivate and introduce a framework for comparing critiquing ability to generation and discrimination ability. Our measurements suggest that even large models may still have relevant knowledge they cannot or do not articulate as critiques. These results are a proof of concept for using AI-assisted human feedback to scale the supervision of machine learning systems to tasks that are difficult for humans to evaluate directly. We release our training datasets, as well as samples from our critique assistance experiments. 

我们使用行为克隆微调大型语言模型以编写自然语言批评(自然语言批评评论)。在基于主题的总结任务中，我们的模型编写的批评可以帮助人们在总结中找到他们本来会错过的缺陷。我们的模型有助于发现模型和人类书面摘要中自然发生的缺陷，以及人类编写的摘要中故意误导的缺陷。我们研究基于主题的总结和综合任务的批评的缩放属性。较大的模型会写出更有用的批评，并且在大多数任务中，尽管有更难批评的输出，但更善于自我批评。较大的模型也可以整合自己的自我批评作为反馈，将自己的总结提炼成更好的总结。最后，我们激励并引入了一个比较批评能力与生成和辨别能力的框架。我们的测量表明，即使是大型模型也可能仍然具有它们无法或不会作为批评表达的相关知识。这些结果证明了使用人工智能辅助人类反馈将机器学习系统的监督扩展到人类难以直接评估的任务的概念。我们发布了训练数据集，以及来自批判辅助实验的样本。

## 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Motivation
With increasingly capable language models, it is important to ensure models are trustworthy on difficult and high stakes tasks. For example, models are being used to write complex pieces of code [CTJ+21, LCC+22] and answer open-ended questions about the world [NHB+21, MTM+22]. We would like to be able to train models that don’t write buggy code or spread misinformation.

随着语言模型能力的不断增强，确保模型在困难和高风险的任务中值得信赖非常重要。例如，模型被用于编写复杂的代码片段[CTJ+21，LCC+22]并回答关于世界的开放式问题[NHB+21，MTM+22]。我们希望能够训练不编写错误代码或传播错误信息的模型。

However, fully evaluating correctness of code or veracity of facts about the world requires a lot of effort and expertise. Techniques to train systems from human feedback [NR+00, Wes16, CLB+17,JMD20, NMS+21, SCC+22], fundamentally depend on humans’ ability to demonstrate and evaluate the quality of model outputs. This leads to the problem of scalable oversight [AOS+16]: How can we effectively provide feedback to models on tasks that are difficult for humans to evaluate?

然而，全面评估代码的正确性或世界事实的真实性需要大量的努力和专业知识。从人类反馈训练系统的技术[NR+00，Wes16，CLB+17，JMD20，NMS+21，SCC+22]从根本上取决于人类展示和评估模型输出质量的能力。这导致了可扩展监督的问题[AOS+16]：我们如何有效地向模型提供人类难以评估的任务的反馈？

One idea to overcome this problem is to use AI systems to aid human evaluation. This basic idea comes up in many prior proposals, such as iterated amplification [CSA18], debate [ICA18], and recursive reward modeling [LKE+18]. If we first train a model to perform simpler assistive tasks that humans can evaluate, then we can use this model to assist humans with the evaluation of harder tasks. A key assumption is that evaluating the assistance task is simpler than evaluating the "base" task. For example, verifying a bug in code is easier than finding bugs. This idea can also be justified by making an analogy between scalable oversight and complexity theory (Appendix B).

克服这个问题的一个想法是使用人工智能系统来帮助人类评估。这个基本思想出现在许多先前的提案中，例如迭代放大[CSA18]，辩论[ICA18]和递归奖励建模[LKE+18]。如果我们首先训练一个模型来执行人类可以评估的更简单的辅助任务，那么我们可以使用这个模型来帮助人类评估更困难的任务。一个关键的假设是，评估辅助任务比评估“基本”任务更简单。例如，验证代码中的 bug 比查找 bug 更容易。这个想法也可以通过在可扩展的监督和复杂性理论之间进行类比来证明(附录B)。

Figure 1: Assistance from our models reliably causes labelers to find more critiques, on answers generated from all three distributions (x-axis). Most of the critiques found in the assistance condition came directly from using model critiques. The number of used model critiques is comparable to the number of critiques found in the “no assist” condition.
Note: Throughout the paper, all error bars shown either use bootstrapping at the passage level or simply calculate standard error of the mean (when appropriate), and represent z = 1 (i.e. one standard deviation on each side). All results use data from test set passages which were held out from training.

注意：在整个论文中，显示的所有误差条要么在通道级别使用自举，要么简单地计算平均值的标准误差(在适当的情况下)，并表示z = 1(即每侧一个标准差)。所有结果都使用来自训练中保留的测试集段落的数据。

In this work we explore a simple form of assistance: natural language critiques of model outputs. Critiques are a particularly natural form of assistance from the point of view of preventing misleading outputs. If a human evaluator doesn’t carefully check a model’s outputs, the model might learn to give solutions that look good to the evaluator but are systematically flawed in a way that exploits human biases. We hope an equally smart critique model can help humans to notice these flaws. If models can generate outputs they “know” have flaws, but cannot explain these flaws to human evaluators, then they won’t be effective assistants. This further motivates us to improve a model’s ability to critique relative to its ability to discriminate answer quality.

在这项工作中，我们探索了一个简单的帮助形式：模型输出的自然语言批评。从防止误导性输出的角度来看，批评是一种特别自然的帮助形式。如果人类评估者不仔细检查模型的输出，模型可能会学会给出对评估者来说看起来不错但存在系统性缺陷的解决方案，从而利用人类偏见。我们希望一个同样聪明的批评模型可以帮助人类注意到这些缺陷。如果模型可以生成它们“知道”有缺陷的输出，但不能向人类评估者解释这些缺陷，那么它们就不会成为有效的助手。这进一步激励我们提高模型相对于其辨别答案质量的能力的批判能力。

## 1.2 Contributions
We fine-tune large language models [BMR+20, CND+22, HBM+22] jointly on both a base task and its corresponding critique task. For the base task, we focus primarily on a topic-based summarization task of summarizing some particular aspect of a given passage. The critique task is to find errors in topic-based summaries, given a passage and topic. We additionally study some synthetic tasks.

我们对大型语言模型[BMR+20、CND+22、HBM+22]进行了微调，共同完成了基本任务及其相应的批判任务。对于基础任务，我们主要关注基于主题的摘要任务，即总结给定段落的某些特定方面。批评的任务是找出基于主题的总结中的错误，给出一个段落和主题。我们还研究了一些合成任务。

Our key contributions are: 
1. Model-written critiques help humans find flaws they would have missed (Figure 1, Section 3.4). Human labelers asked to find critiques of (model or human-written) answers find about 50% more critiques when given assistance from a critique model. Furthermore, with answers written to be deliberately misleading, assisted labelers find the intended critiques 50% more often. 
2. Critique helpfulness scales favorably with model capabilities (Figure 4, Section 4.2). Larger models are generally better at critiquing themselves, despite having harder-to-critique answers. That is, their ability to critique keeps up with their ability to give more convincing answers. We generally observe similar but less consistent trends on synthetic tasks (Figure 5). 
3. Large models can use critiques to help refine their own answers (Figure 6, Section 4.3). Model-generated critiques help models directly improve their own answers. Using rejection sampling to find good critiques makes this improvement larger than a baseline of refining directly without a critique. For both kinds of refinement, improvement scales favorably with model size, with small models showing no improvement. 
4. We motivate and measure generator-discriminator-critique gaps (Section 5). We propose a new methodology to compare a model’s ability to generate answers, discriminate answer quality, and critique answers. Using the methodology, we study the scaling trends on topic-based summarization and in synthetic domains. In our experiments we failed to find a clear trend showing critique performance catching up to discriminator performance, implying that larger models still have relevant knowledge they don’t articulate as critiques. Future effort should be directed at studying and improving on critique performance relative to discrimination performance. 
5. We release our training datasets and samples from our assistance experiments. We release a dataset with tens of thousands of human-written critiques, refinements, critique evaluations, and more, used to train our topic-based summarization models. We also release a dataset from our assistance experiments, including a dataset of misleading answers and intended flaws. 

我们的主要贡献是：
1. 模型书面评论有助于人类发现他们可能错过的缺陷(图1，第3.4节)。被要求寻找对(模型或人类书面)答案的评论的人类标签者在获得评论模型的帮助时，会发现大约50%的评论。此外，由于答案是故意误导的，辅助贴标机发现预期的批评次数增加了50%。
2. 批评有益性与模型能力之间存在良好的比例关系(图4，第4.2节)。较大的模型通常更善于批评自己，尽管有更难批评的答案。即,他们的批判能力与给出更令人信服的答案的能力保持一致。我们通常在合成任务上观察到类似但不太一致的趋势(图5)。
3. 大型模型可以使用评论来帮助完善自己的答案(图6，第4.3节)。模型生成的评论帮助模型直接改进自己的答案。使用拒绝抽样来找到好的批评，这一改进比直接精炼而没有批评的基线更大。对于这两种改进，改进随着模型尺寸的增加而增加，而小模型则没有改进。
4. 我们激励和衡量发电机鉴别器的批评差距(第5节)。我们提出了一种新的方法来比较模型生成答案、区分答案质量和评价答案的能力。使用该方法，我们研究了基于主题的摘要和合成领域的缩放趋势。在我们的实验中，我们没有发现一个明显的趋势，即批判者的表现会赶上鉴别者的表现，这意味着更大的模型仍然有相关的知识，它们无法作为批判来表达。未来的工作应该针对研究和改进与歧视表现相关的批评表现。
5. 我们发布了我们的辅助实验的训练数据集和样本。我们发布了一个数据集，其中包含数以万计的人类书面评论、改进、评论评估等，用于训练基于主题的摘要模型。我们还发布了辅助实验的数据集，包括误导性答案和预期缺陷的数据集。

## 2 Dataset collection and model training
At a high level, we start with collecting demonstrations of some “base task,” and use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train models to do that task. We then collect demonstrations of critiques of the model’s answers, and fine-tune a new model to jointly do the base task and critique task. We proceed to iterate, with many rounds of data collection for a variety of tasks, and with the models training jointly on all tasks.

## 2.1 Structure of tasks
First, we assume there is some arbitrary base task. We assume no structure to the task, except that there should be some input, which we call the question, and output, the answer. The critique task then asks for a flaw in the answer to be pointed out, given the question and answer pair.

We then define corresponding binary discrimination tasks, which judge the outputs to the base task (answers) and critique task (critiques). The answer discrimination task—whether the answer contains any flaws—is called critiqueability. We hope that whenever an answer is critiqueable, we would be able to generate a concrete critique. The critique discrimination task—whether a critique points out a legitimate shortcoming of the answer—is called helpfulness.

Finally, we define a refinement task, in which we ask for a new answer, in light of some critique of an answer. We call this conditional refinement, to distinguish it from the variant of direct refinement— giving a better answer given an existing answer without conditioning on a critique. Of course, we can also ask for critiqueability of refinement outputs.

For a summary of these tasks, see Table 1. For an example, see Table 2. 3

Question: Our King has always been a little different. He’s very quiet I haven’t really seen him give anyone orders at all either. Whenever something needs to be done I see him doing it. [. . .] That’s when I believed everything he told me - while he took me adventuring with him. Now I know that there is a better life to be had out of this one. A less edged and more rounded one. Thank you king Steve. Minecraft Steve.

Summarize the story’s setting.

Answer: The story is set in a medieval kingdom, where the king is the main character of the story. The king is described as a good and active king. The narrator is a child who has always wondered why the king is so different from everyone else.

Critiqueable: Yes

Critique: The answer should mention that the setting is a video game.

Helpful: Yes

Conditional refinement: The story is set in a medieval kingdom in the video game Minecraft. The king is the main character of the story. The king is described as a good and active king. The narrator is a child who has always wondered why the king is so different from everyone else.

Table 2: Representative example of a topic-based summarization task, and its associated tasks. See

Appendix A.5 for details on how we format our tasks (different than shown).

## 2.2 Topic-based summarization
We report most of our main results on the base task of topic-based summarization [Dan05, ZYY+21], a task similar to or interchangeable with query-based summarization and question-focused summarization. In topic-based summarization, the summary focuses on a specific aspect of a text rather than trying to summarize the whole text. See Table 2 for an example.

We collected our own dataset of over 6,000 distinct topical queries and summaries, on over 2,000 distinct passages. Our distribution of passages is sampled from a dataset of short stories, Wikipedia articles, or web articles (mostly news) scraped from the internet. Most tasks were generated based on short texts with less than 2,048 tokens when encoded with the GPT-2 tokenizer [RWC+19]. We also gathered some tasks based on texts with up to 4,096 tokens which were not used for training.

Our labelers generated between 1 and 8 topic-based summarization questions per passage, typically also including a topic not covered by the passage (for which the answer is empty). Summaries are up to a paragraph long – we targeted between 2-10 sentences unless the topic was missing. We aimed for these topics to be non-trivial to summarize in various ways. See Appendix A for details.

### 2.2.1 Data collection
We collect demonstrations on all the tasks mentioned in Section 2.1. Given a task for which we want to collect a demonstration, we can choose whether each input is generated from a model or human.

We always use a human-generated question. All tasks but the base task require an answer as input, many for which we typically use outputs from our best model. For example, critique demonstrations are on model-generated answers, and helpfulness judgements are on model-generated critiques. For refinements the situation is more complex, and detailed in Appendix A.2.

Since we need model outputs for most demonstrations, we collect data in rounds. After each round, we train a model jointly on all task demonstrations collected thus far. We start with base task demonstration collection. Then with a model trained on only the base task, we collect demonstrations for critiqueability, critique, and refinement tasks using model-generated answers. Finally, we collect demonstrations for helpfulness tasks, by showing labelers model-generated critiques of modelgenerated answers.

For more details on our data collection, see Appendix A and Table 4. We publicly release all data used to train final models2 . 2We release six files, located at https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/critiques/dataset/: base/train.jsonl.gz, base/test.jsonl.gz, critiques/train.jsonl.gz, critiques/test.jsonl.gz, helpfulness/train.jsonl.gz, helpfulness/test.jsonl.gz 4

### 2.2.2 Models
Similarly to [DL15, RNSS18, BHA+21], we start with foundation models pre-trained to autoregressively predict the next token in a large text corpus. All of our models are transformer decoders [VSP+17] in the style of GPT-3 [RNSS18, BMR+20].

We fine-tune pre-trained models using supervised learning to predict human labels on all of these tasks. Joint training means that there is no capability asymmetry between the base and critique models—thus we expect that any mistakes the base model “knows about” would also be “known” by the critique model.

We combine critiqueability tasks with answer “Yes” and critique tasks into a single training example (see Appendix A.5). Otherwise we have each example corresponding to a task, and shuffle all the examples for training. Note that our examples are not i.i.d. for multiple reasons: we have multiple questions per passage, the refinement demonstrations are collected at the same time as critique demonstrations, etc. See Appendix A for details.

Our models are trained for one epoch and we tune only the learning rate, with remaining hyperparameters fixed to be similar to pre-training.

We mask out all tokens except those corresponding to the human demonstrations. For example, in the critique task, we mask out the passage, topic, and answer being critiqued. See Appendix A.5 for details on input format.

Critiqueability and helpfulness score

Recall that for discrimination tasks, we collect binary yes/no labels. Rather than sampling binary labels from our models, we can look directly at logits to recover a probability. Thus we often use the terms critiqueability score and helpfulness score to refer to the quantity Pr[Yes]

Pr[Yes]+Pr[No] on the corresponding input.

On the critique task we “force” the model to give a critique even if the answer is perfect. Separately, the critiqueability score can be used to determine whether to ask it to critique in the first place, and the helpfulness score can be used to determine whether the critique is good after the fact.

Model scale

We use five pre-trained models with varying capabilities. Our pre-trained models are unfortunately not directly comparable to one another (for example, due to different pre-training datasets). However, on models which are directly comparable, the number of parameters correlates strongly with supervised fine-tuning validation loss. Using loss as the natural way to compare models of different architecture is suggested by [CCG+22], though here we use loss measured on fine-tuning instead of pre-training since it is the dataset commonality. Thus throughout the paper, we use “model scale” to refer to loss, measured in nats per token, and use that instead of model size for scaling laws [KMH+20].

## 2.3 Synthetic tasks
We also report results on four “synthetic” tasks, described in Table 3. For these tasks, we don’t require human data collection because we have binary ground truth for both answer and critique validity. We use hand-coded oracles for each of the base, critiqueability, critique, and helpfulness tasks.

Our tasks are chosen based on two criteria:

### 1. Evaluating critiques is easier than evaluating the base tasks.
##### 2. The task is difficult but possible for most models. We tweak free parameters (e.g. sentence
 length for the unscramble task or number of digits for addition) to achieve this.

For our synthetic task models, we trained two rounds of models:

### 1. First we train on 100,000 generated base tasks with oracle demonstrations.
## 2. We then add 100,000 critiqueability task demonstrations, sub-sampled such that exactly
 half have incorrect answers, and 50,000 critique task demonstrations on that half. Answers are sampled from the first model at temperature 0, which we find improves accuracy. (We 5

Answer: 1 = C, 2 = D

Critique: Answer to question 2 should be A

Table 3: Synthetic tasks with examples occasionally repeat tasks when accuracy is so low or high that sub-sampling cannot guarantee uniqueness.)

This setup differs from the setup of topic-based summarization in two ways: (1) Each different model size is fine-tuned on a qualitatively different dataset in the second round. For topic-based summarization, different models are all trained on the same dataset. (2) We don’t do a third round of training on helpfulness tasks, although we do use the helpfulness oracle for evaluations. 3 Assisting critique finding

We ran experiments where our models assist human labelers at writing a set of critiques for answers.

The assistance itself is a set of critiques shown to the labeler.

## 3.1 Motivation
We chose this task because:
• Finding critiques is an important subtask of evaluating answer quality in general.
• We thought it would be the easiest task to use to measure the effect of model assistance. We initially tried a comparison-based task but it was more difficult to work with (see Appendix

E).
• Suggesting critiques is a particularly natural form of assistance for critique-finding. 6

Figure 2: Even though the largest contribution from our models is finding more minor errors, model assistance also helps uncover some major and critical errors (left). The majority of model-written critiques point out lack of summary coverage, but there is also increase in found inaccuracies (right).

Importantly, our models do not have to always produce valid critiques to be helpful to human labelers, though too many invalid critiques would waste the labelers’ time.

## 3.2 Setup
Labelers are given a topic-based summarization question and summary, and instructed to write as many different possible critiques as they can think of for the summary. They are also instructed to only read as much of the text as necessary to write the critiques.

In the baseline no assist condition, the labeler had no assistance and had to write all critiques themselves. In the assist condition, the labeler would also see 8 model-generated critiques of the answer, one at each of the following temperatures: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 1.0]. Critiques were de-duplicated, sorted according to the model’s helpfulness score, and shown to the human labeler along with their helpfulness scores. The labeler could click a button to "use" any of the model generated critiques. If they did this, it would pre-fill the labeler critique with the model-written text, which they could further edit. We use our best model for generating all assistance.

We use questions for longer passages (2048 to 3840 tokens in length) in order to observe a larger effect from assistance. We noticed no degradation in critique writing ability despite training only on passages up to length 2048.

For each question, we use three different kinds of answers to critique:
• Model: An answer sampled from our best model, the same as the critiquing model, using a randomly chosen temperature.3
• Human: An answer generated by a labeler doing the base task honestly.
• Human misleading: An answer generated by the same labeler to deliberately have a hard-to-detect flaw. (Details in Appendix A).

This results in six total conditions. For each summary, we had six labelers finding critiques, assigning one to each of the six conditions. We ensured labelers had not seen the text before (if they had, it would get reassigned). We did not limit the amount of time the labeler took performing the task: we instructed them to take enough time to cover all possible critiques of the answer at least 90% of the time.

We also ask the labeler to provide a 1-7 Likert rating for quality of the answer, with 7 indicating a perfect answer. For each critique the labeler finds, we ask for a severity level, ranging from minor to critical, and a category (described in Appendix A). 3Throughout the paper, “randomly chosen temperature” means a temperature drawn uniformly at random from the set {0, 0.1, . . . , 0.9, 1}. 7

## 3.3 Findings
We find that critiques written by our model significantly help labelers find critiques:

### 1. Assistance helps labelers find more critiques under all answer conditions (Figure 1).
In the assistance conditions, most labeler-written critiques “used” a model-critique and the number of used critiques is comparable to the number of critiques found without assistance.

Only 15.3% of the used critiques were edited further.

### 2. Assistance does not appreciably affect the time taken by labelers (Figure 15). The
 primary effect is that labelers take a bit longer because they write more critiques when given assistance.

### 3. The number of critiques increases for all severity levels and critique categories (Figure 2). Though the biggest increases comes from minor critiques, we also find increases in
 major and critical critiques. Similarly, we see the biggest increase in coverage critiques, but also a modest increase in accuracy critiques.

### 4. With assistance answers are more frequently critiqued and are given lower ratings (Figure 16). This suggests that the increase in critiques translates to a different
 subjective sense of quality. For example, on model answers, unassisted labelers found critiques on just 54% of inputs and gave an average rating of 5.6, while assisted labelers found critiques on 78% of inputs and gave an average rating of 4.9.

Note that our critique model was trained on data from the same pool of labelers—we are essentially leveraging our models to bootstrap our labelers to be more careful at the base task.

### 3.3.1 Checking for intended critiques
One potential confounder for our results is that because labelers are shown many critiques, they are occasionally erring and accepting critiques that are not truly valid. In other words, we have no way to distinguish between a valid critique of a poor answer from a misleading critique of a valid answer.

To break this symmetry, we had the authors of the misleading answers also generate the corresponding “intended” critiques (usually just one per answer). We then ask them to check whether the other labelers in the assistance experiment found critiques covering the intended critiques. We also ask them to independently judge whether each of the new critiques was valid (we assume the intended critiques are valid).

We find that:

## 1. With assistance, labelers find the intended critiques 45 ± 5% of the time, whereas without
 assistance they only find it 27 ± 5% of the time.

## 2. The fraction of critiques the author considers valid does not appreciably decrease with
 assistance (71% with assistance versus 73% without).

######## 3. However, the number of valid critiques is still much higher, 0.96 ± 0.09 vs. 0.62 ± 0.07.
######## 4. With assistance, labelers also find more valid and novel critiques, 0.24±0.06 vs. 0.18±0.05.
## 3.4 Dataset release
We release a comprehensive dataset of results4 . This includes the assistance provided, critiques used and written, ratings given, and the intended critiques. Random samples from this dataset can be found in Appendix F.2. 4 Critique quality results

In this section, we present a number of other results on critique quality. We find that critique quality is enabled by scale: 4 https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/critiques/assistance.jsonl.gz 8

Figure 3: Our model gives more helpful critiques than InstructGPT baselines, but still significantly less helpful critiques than humans.

### 1. Larger models’ critiques are rated as more helpful by humans. This holds even if making
 the answer distribution correspondingly difficult to critique by asking them to self-critique.

### 2. Larger models are able to improve outputs using critique-conditional refinements. We verify
 the critique is helping by comparing to a direct refinement baseline.

## 4.1 Helpfulness
The simplest way to measure critique quality is by looking at helpfulness as judged by human labelers.

To check that our supervised fine-tuned model is not overly nit-picky, we also asked labelers to mark whether each critique was clearly and unambiguously helpful.

We compare our best critique model to human-written critiques, and to baseline models. For baselines, we use a model trained in the style of InstructGPT [OWJ+22] from the same pretrained model. We use this model both using a zero-shot instruction-based context, and with few-shot contexts in the style of [RWC+19, BMR+20]. For this evaluation, answers were generated randomly from either one of our large fine-tuned models, or an InstructGPT baseline model with zero-shot or few-shot prompting. We then evaluated on answers for which humans found critiques (“critiqueable answers”).

Overall we find our model’s critiques to be helpful more often than the baselines, but still substantially less helpful than human critiques (Figure 3). We found the InstructGPT models to give surprisingly helpful critiques, considering that they were not trained on our task at all.

## 4.2 Self-critiquing helpfulness and scaling
In Section 3.4, we showed that models are able to help humans find critiques on the distribution of answers coming from the same model.

One natural question to ask is: Should a model be able to reliably find flaws in its own outputs? After all, if it understands these flaws, it could have perhaps avoided them in the first place. However, there is at least one major reason you still might expect a model to identify its own mistakes:

Recognizing errors is easier than avoiding them. Equivalently, verifying solutions is easier than finding them (compare to P ⊆ NP from computational complexity theory).

It’s possible that our model can identify and critique all of its mistakes. This motivates us to look at the percentage of the time poor outputs have helpful critiques. The higher this percentage, the easier it will be to assist humans in evaluation of the base task. 9 (a) More capable models have critiqueable outputs (b) Helpfulness of self-critiques, as judged by human laaround 20% less often than the smallest models, ac- belers, both with and without filtering by when labelers cording to labelers.

(c) Larger models are not only better at critiquing, but harder to critique – even filtering for only cases where labelers found a critique. The diagonal (spanning lower left to upper right) corresponds to the “critiqueable answers” line in 4b.

Figure 4: More capable models are significantly better at self-critiquing (Figure 4b). Although more capable models get better at generating hard-to-critique answers (Figure 4c), their ability to critique their answers is improving more rapidly with scale. This is true even without adjusting for the fact that humans find fewer critiques of more capable models (Figure 4a). In all figures, we sample at the same random temperature for both the base task and critique task; the effects are equally visible at all temperature ranges (not pictured). 10

Figure 5: Helpfulness of self-critiques for synthetic tasks, according to a critique validity oracle. Like

Figure 4, we show with and without filtering for critiqueable answers (according to a critiqueability oracle).

On topic-based summarization, we find that larger models are better at critiquing themselves (Figure 4b), even without filtering for critiqueable answers. This holds even though answers from larger models are harder to critique (Figure 4a, 4c).

One caveat is that our supervised dataset contains more critiques of outputs from larger models, since we typically use relatively capable answer models. However, we believe this effect to be minimal.

On synthetic tasks, we generally observe similar trends in the critiqueable case (Figure 5), though the story is less clear. Overall, we have no strong reason to believe positive critique scaling to be a fundamental trend. We also do not know, for example, whether the trend would also go away if we use reinforcement learning to train both the answer and critique model. Nevertheless, we believe models have only recently reached a scale where critiquing on realistic tasks is possible.

## 4.3 Refinements
Another check of whether model-generated critiques are useful is to compare critique-conditional refinements to direct refinements. In other words, we compare refinements generated using only an answer to refinements generated using both an answer and a critique of that answer.

In order to improve conditional refinement performance, we can improve the critique. To do that, we do best-of-N [SOW+20] against the helpfulness score; we sample N critiques, choose the best according to the model’s helpfulness score, and use that critique for the conditional refinement. For direct refinements, we take best-of-N refinements using our model’s critiqueability score.

In our refinement experiments we ask for a refinement regardless of whether the initial answer is critiqueable. If the initial answer were perfect, the model would have no chance at improving it.

Thus in order to not “force” the model to refine, we compare the refinement to the original using the model’s critiqueability score.

We also include baselines of the original “best-of-1” sample, and a best-of-8 sample (generating new answers from scratch, and ranking them by critiqueability). These experiments use temperature 0.5 to sample, which we believe to be near optimal for best-of-1 on all tasks (answering, critiquing, and refinements). 11

### 4.3.1 Findings
Our results are depicted in Figures 6 and 7 and samples can be found in Appendix F.3. Despite being somewhat noisy, these results suggest:

#### 1. Good critiques help refinement. Good critiques are useful for refinement. Conditional
 refinement appear to outperform direct refinements, but only with critiques selected via best-of-N against helpfulness. Larger N helps improve the conditional refinements.

### 2. Large model scale enables refinements. Both forms of refinement significantly outperform
 the original output for larger models, but have little to no effect for smaller models.

### 3. Using critiques may not be competitive if controlling for compute. Rejection sampling
 to select better critiques to use for refinements is competitive with rejection sampling on answers, a roughly compute-equalized baseline.5 However, rejection sampling on direct refinements appears to be a stronger baseline. 5 Generator-discriminator-critique (GDC) gaps

In this section, we present results suggesting that models are not articulating all the problems they “know about.” Furthermore, despite the positive results in critique scaling from Section 4.2, we do not see evidence that the gap between our models’ discrimination and critique writing abilities is closing with scale.

## 5.1 Setup
In this section we consider the following three tasks:
• G: answer generation
• D: answer discrimination (critiqueability)
• C: answer critiquing

In our main results from Section 4.2, we compared tasks G and C: To what extent can a model critique its own answers when they are poor? Comparing G and D is also interesting: Can a model tell when its own outputs are good or poor? As with critique scaling, we have two competing trends:

The discriminators are getting better in an absolute sense, but the critiqueable answers may also be getting harder or subtler to critique.

Finally, we argue that the gap between D and C is especially interesting: if a model can tell an answer is poor, can it also point out the flaw to a human? If we could train models to always point out when they notice flaws, this could go a long way towards having trustworthy and aligned models. For more discussion, see Appendix C.

This motivates us to measure these quantities in such a way that:
• The different tasks can be compared on the same axis. For each pair, we will aim to measure a "XY gap" measuring the amount Y performance exceeds X performance
• The GC gap corresponds to effectiveness of self-critiquing. A positive gap corresponds to ability to improve or check outputs by showing humans critiques.
• The GD gap corresponds to the model’s ability to know when answers it produces are poor.

A positive gap corresponds to ability to improve outputs using a discriminator.
• The CD gap corresponds to the model’s ability to give human-understandable critiques on answers it “knows” are flawed (and inability to give convincing critiques on sound answers).

Our hope is to ultimately use critiques for better training signal on difficult tasks. In a sense, we would like to take measurements that let us scope out how well this works without actually training our models on this task (see Appendix C.3.3). 5This is mildly surprising since rejection sampling on answers gives "fresh starts" while refinements are sometimes forced to start with a poor answer. We speculate that with enough compute budget, it is optimal to use a combination of the two, as well as iterative refinement. 12 (a) Comparison of critique-conditional refinements to (b) Using “forced” refinements, we see that small modthree baselines: the original sample, a direct refinement, els are exceptionally bad at conditional refinements. and a best-of-8. Small models are poor at refining. For In this setting, the model has no ability to opt out of large models, critique-conditional refinements outper- critiquing or direct-refining. form baselines.

Figure 6: Critiques help with refining answers. They are also competitive with direct refinements, and a best-of-8 baseline. However, these are only true at scale. Win rate is measured relative to the original (best-of-1) answer from the same model. All critiques and refinements are generated from the same model as the answer, and all generations are at T=0.5.

Figure 7: Critique refinement and direct refinement scaling with rejection sampling. Figure 7a assesses conditional refinements optimizing the critique against helpfulness score, whereas Figure 7b assesses direct refinements optimizing the refinement against critiqueability score. Win rate is measured relative to the original (best-of-1) answer from the same model. All critiques and refinements are generated from the same model as the answer, and all generations are at T=0.5. 13

Figure 8: GDC gaps for topic-based summarization, using humans as ground truth. We measure sample quality using various metrics. "Diff" metrics subtract out the values for the generator. Note that best-of-2 against human win rate against best-of-1 would be exactly 75% if not for labelers marking ties. Overall, GD and GC gaps may be slightly increasing, but CD gap is positive and shows no trend.

In this section, we present one such way of measuring and our results using it.

## 5.2 Measuring gaps
We propose comparing these tasks to each other using the following methodology:
• G: What is the average performance of a generator sample?
• D: What is the performance of the generator with best-of-N against the discriminator?
• C: What is the performance of the generator with best-of-N against the severity of a critique?

For measuring C, we essentially use critiques as a discriminator: to judge an answer we generate a critique and consider the answer poor if any critique is valid and severe, according to a human. 14

Figure 9: GDC gaps for synthetic tasks, using an oracle as ground truth. We also show the oracle best-of-2 discriminator. Note that for binary tasks, win rate is a linear transformation of accuracy gaps. We do not see consistent trends with CD gaps. 15

Our definition for C is not necessarily canonical, but was chosen to be convenient to measure (see

Appendix C.3.2).

With this definition, it is clear that we should generally expect a non-negative GD gap and GC gap. If not, then optimizing against the discriminator or critique training signal makes the generator actively worse. What to expect for the CD gap is less clear. For more discussion, see Appendix C.3.

On a practical level, using best-of-N to measure discrimination ability has many benefits:
• Unlike accuracy, we don’t need to calibrate to the distribution. Our critiqueability models are all trained on the same dataset, but answer models have very different critiqueability (Figure 4a).
• We are most interested in the ability to discriminate between answers to the same question, rather than between answers to different questions, which is conflated by the discriminator’s ability to tell whether a question is difficult. Though our work uses discriminators, this also means the definitions generalize naturally to using a preference based reward model for D.

For our primary results, we use N = 2. This still leaves us with choices for how to measure performance of a sample, and how to measure critique quality.

### 5.2.1 Sample quality
We explore a number of ways to measure sample quality:
• Likert: We ask labelers to rate answers qualitatively on a 1-7 Likert scale.
• Uncritiqueability (binary label): We ask for the fraction of "perfect" outputs according to humans. For synthetic tasks, we use the oracle, so uncritiqueability is the same as accuracy.
• Win rate: We ask labelers for comparisons of the sample in question to a sample from some fixed distribution. In particular, if we use win rate against the generator (we can vary the distribution across model sizes), this makes measurements somewhat natural to compare across model sizes. This makes it so that G is always 0.5, and D and C are always at most 1 − 2 1

N . In the case where the outcome is binary, win rate is simply a linear transformation from accuracy: (1 + ACC − accG) /2.

A large caveat is that for topic-based summarization, these methods are all potentially flawed, as suggested by our results in Section 3.4. This is especially problematic if labelers fail to find critiques in systematic ways (rather than, e.g. independently failing to find critiques with some probability).

### 5.2.2 Critique severity
For critique severity measurement, the most straightforward thing is to use human-evaluated severity, with unhelpful critiques being least severe. For topic-based summarization, we again use humans for ground truth, and additionally break ties between helpful critiques using severity.

For synthetic tasks, we again use binary helpfulness ground truth as if it were acting as the human being assisted. This simulates a human judgement in a setting where the humans can easily evaluate critiques, but not the base task answers.

A downside of this approach is that it makes it possible for the model to find flaws by “trying out” critiques it has low confidence in. This means that C effectively gets to leverage a bit of search against ground truth, which D does not get to do. Therefore one could expect a negative CD gap. However this “search effect” should be quite small in the limit of scale with larger models – humans are doing a relatively simple task of critique validation, compared to the difficult task of finding a critique. If the effect exists, it is a genuine advantage of having a human in the loop. For more discussion, see

Appendix C.3.1.

## 5.3 Results
We report our main topic-based summarization gap results in Figure 8 and our synthetic task gap results in Figure 9. For topic-based summarization, we use a random non-zero temperature for the 16 answer, and use the same temperature for critiques. For synthetic tasks, we use temperature 1 for the answer, and temperature 0 for critiques6 .

We find that:

## 1. We consistently observe positive GD and GC gaps, as expected, except when models are
 completely unable to do the task.

## 2. We observe a positive CD gap for topic-based summarization and 3-SAT and negative gap
 for Addition and RACE.

### 3. For topic-based summarization, the CD gap is approximately constant across model scale.
## 4. For most synthetic tasks, CD gap may be decreasing with model size, but the opposite is true
 for RACE, where critiquing is close to oracle performance (and is easy relative to knowing when to critique).

Overall, this suggests that gaps are task-specific, and it is not apparent whether we can close the CD gap in general.

We believe the CD gap will generally be harder to close for difficult and realistic tasks. For example, on topic-based summarization the discriminator may be able to identify the labeler who gave the answer based on their writing style, and guess that some labelers give more critiqueable answers, without knowing the critiques. This does not happen with synthetic tasks.

We believe much more work on gaps is possible, and present a few more variants and results in

Appendix C.3. Overall, we are excited for future study of gaps as a way to measure headroom for pushing critique performance, and as a way to improve methods for scalable oversight. 6 Related work

More recently, [WWS+22b] propose using language models’ own outputs to improve their answers on math word problems. 7 Discussion

We view our results as a proof of concept for feedback assistance as a solution to the problem of scalable oversight: Even though topic-based summarization isn’t actually a hard task for human labelers, in our experiments we still see significant gains from AI assistance in the form of critiques.

## 7.1 Implications for alignment research
## 1. Large language models are already capable enough to meaningfully assist human evaluation and the scaling trend in Figure 4 suggests that larger models may improve at assisting
 in evaluating their own outputs. The publicly available InstructGPT models are capable of critiquing well few-shot and even zero-shot (Figure 3). Overall, we believe there is potential to do empirical experiments for scalable oversight with today’s models, using schemes similar to reward modeling [LKE+18] or debate [IA19].

## 2. Generator-discriminator-critique gaps are promising ways to measure alignment
 properties of models. Studying gaps give us insight into quality of base task training signal without training those models (see Appendix C.3). Increasing the critique performance relative to generator and discriminator performance is an under-explored research area, where results should directly translate into better-aligned models. Studying gaps can also happen on smaller models in synthetic domains, like those in Table 3.

### 3. Learning from natural language feedback is feasible now. Feedback in preference learning [CLB+17] is very information-sparse, and humans typically spend several minutes on a
 comparison yielding a single bit of information. Ideally, models could use human natural language feedback to improve their own outputs [SCC+22]. In Section 4.3, we showed models can now condition on critiques as a form of feedback to improve their own outputs, results corroborated by recent works on "chain of thought" [WWS+22b]. This suggests teaching models with natural language feedback from humans is a very promising direction.

## 7.2 Limitations
### 1. Lack of ground truth. Our base task of topic-based summarization does not have a robust
 or objective process for validating the quality of the answers or critiques. (a) Labelers may be misevaluating answers, by trusting the model summaries too much or by simply making mistakes. (b) Some critiques found by the labelers using assistance were fairly unimportant or nitpicky. Agreement rate on comparisons of critiques (i.e. helpfulness rankings) were no higher than answer comparisons; both were around 75%. (c) Misleading critiques of good outputs may be indistinguishable from good critiques of poor outputs. (d) More broadly, we do not address how to measure ground truth, which makes this research difficult. Our work relies on labelers, who already make mistakes and will be increasingly unreliable for harder tasks.

### 2. Assuming articulable reasoning. Our overall research direction does not address how to
 surface problematic outputs where a model cannot put into words what the problem is, which may be a core difficulty of the alignment problem [CCX21]. The CD gap could remain large after much effort using assistance.

### 3. Assuming reconcilable preferences. Critiques as a training signal may not make sense
 for more inherently subjective tasks, where labelers have differing preferences. It may be impossible to have uncritiqueable outputs (at least without specifying how to resolve disagreements). On the other hand, for subjective tasks having a strong critique model can make it easier to adapt a model to each labeler’s individual preferences because it lets them rank the critiques they care about without having to find all of them. 18

### 4. Evaluation is not always easier than generation. For some tasks it will not be possible
 to find assistance tasks that are simpler to evaluate than the base task. For example, asking about how to solve climate change may result in complex economic questions. And asking complex economic questions may in turn ask for predictions about the effects of climate change.

### 5. Lack of difficulty. Our base task is not actually very hard for humans to evaluate, resulting
 in little headroom for assistance to help. Humans take up to around ten minutes to do the task, so we do not observe much speed-up from assistance. In general, model-assisted evaluation is most valuable on tasks that are actually difficult for humans to evaluate, and so positive results on an easier task might not be reproducible on harder tasks.

### 6. Under-optimized models. We only use supervised fine-tuning while models like InstructGPT [OWJ+22] trained on similar tasks benefit significantly from reinforcement learning
 as an additional step. This also means that our model is unlikely to output critiques that no human labeler would have written themselves.

#### 7. Difficulty of setup. Our setup may be difficult to replicate. It requires large models, a lot of
 human data, and multiple rounds of training.

## 7.3 Future directions
We believe our dataset and methods open up many interesting research avenues, which we are excited for researchers to explore. For example:
• Study human cognitive errors and misleading models: Future concerns about misalignment are currently very abstract. It would be useful to produce concrete examples of human supervision being systematically biased and leading ML training to produce systems that mislead their supervisors.
• Reduce the discriminator-critique gap: We showed that models can learn to generate helpful critiques. But it would be useful to systematically study how far we can push critique training relative to discriminator performance and to understand the obstacles to having models explicate their knowledge.
• Recursive reward modeling: We showed that critiques help human evaluations. A next step could be to improve model performance on the base task by training on assisted evaluations.

Then, if we take assistance itself as a base task, we can then train assistants that help train assistants (e.g. critiquers of critiquers).
• Study assistance methods: We experimented with critiques as one form of assistance, but did not compare it to any other forms of assistance. For example, explanations may be more natural for many tasks. More open-ended settings like question-answering or dialogue [BJN+22] could potentially be better interfaces for assistance.
• Iterative refinements: We collected a large dataset of refinements, but did not explore in depth how to best use these to improve model outputs. For example, one could do multiple refinement iterations, and combine that with best-of-N.
• Disagreeing labelers: Critiques are potentially a natural way to reconcile raters’ disagreements. For real-world tasks, such as summarizing current events, humans may have differing opinions on appropriate contextualization. Some humans may also be unaware of certain problems in outputs (e.g. unrecognized slurs, subtle implications), and model critiques are a possible way to surface them and increase agreement rates.
• Using natural language to train models: discussed above in Section 7.1.

For many of the above directions, we would also like to move to more difficult tasks, but which still have (more objective) ground truth. Some possibilities include coding-related tasks, mathematics, riddles (such as cryptic crosswords), and book-length question-answering. 8 Acknowledgements

During training, 50% of the refinement tasks are converted to direct refinement tasks, and 50% of the corroboration quotes are converted to "answer quotes" A Additional dataset details A.1 Labelers Our labelers are contractors hired by OpenAI and paid hourly. Labelers are fluent in English and the majority are native speakers. We communicate with our labelers via Slack, where we send instructions, gather feedback, and discuss tasks. We occasionally check labeler quality using a variety of techniques: looking at critique likelihood (by other labelers) of their demonstrations, looking at agreement rates on rankings (we generally share 5% of tasks between 10 labelers). A.2 Collection details We collect data in three rounds, roughly corresponding to the base task, the critique task, and the helpfulness task. Thus we have three distinct web interfaces for data collection, each of which went through multiple iterations throughout the project. A.2.1 Base task When collecting data for the base task, we show labelers a passage and ask them to come up with a number of questions, as well as answers to each question. For topic-based summarization, we ask them to have at least one question for which there is no relevant information in the passage and the answer is trivial. Some variants:

## 1. We sometimes also collected misleading answers that should be clearly wrong, but take
 readers a long time to determine as wrong. We asked for labelers to aim to have answers with different kinds of flaws, e.g. accuracy flaws contradicting part of the text that are hard to find or not stated explicitly and coverage flaws leaving out important details that are easy to overlook. We also ask labelers to aim for the flaws to be severe. Finally, labelers wrote critiques of the misleading answer (typically only one, as per the initial requirement that it be hard to spot a flaw).

### 2. We sometimes asked for lists of "quote corroborations". For each quote corroboration, the
 labeler highlighted a set of spans in the answer, and a set of corroborating spans in the passage A.2.2 Critique task When collecting data for the critique task, we show labelers a passage, multiple questions about the passage, and multiple model-generated answers for each question. We always ask for a Likert rating for each answer and a ranking of the answers. 25 Critiques We then ask for a series of critiques for each answer, roughly in descending order of importance or severity. Critiques are instructed to be relatively atomic, so they should not point out multiple unrelated issues. We also asked for critiques to be as specific as possible, avoiding broad critiques like "This answer could be better". Each critique was given a severity, one of "Minor", "Medium", "Major" and "Critical", each intended to be about twice as severe as the previous. Labelers were able to skip critiquing answers that were very similar to another answer. Refinements When we collected refinements, it was done so jointly with critiques, with a corresponding refinement for each critique. Some answers were too poor to be meaningfully refined, in which case labelers marked the answer to be completely rewritten instead. Since we collect multiple critiques, we collect a series of refinements as well, with each refinement being an improvement over the previous refinement (or the original answer). All critiques were expected to apply to the original answer as well as the refinement. (Early on, we had them mark for each critique whether it applied, but we abandoned this later.) Note that this means that for training, all refinement demonstrations were using human-written critiques for input. Furthermore, refinement demonstrations are of model-written answers about half the time, and on (partially) human-written refinements the other half. Critiqueability In collecting critiques, we are also implicitly collecting critiqueability labels. We assume the original answer to be uncritiqueable if and only if no critique is given. We enforce that there are critiques whenever Likert rating is below a 7. Similarly, when refining, the final refinement is assumed to be uncritiqueable, and all previous refinements are assumed to be critiqueable. Variants in data collection that we we explored throughout the project:

## 1. Collecting a set of "corroborations" for each answer, of natural language explanations that
 support the answer.

## 2. No refinements
## 3. For topic-based summarization, we asked for a category for each critique, one of:
 • Coverage: summary missing relevant information from passage • Accuracy: summary giving incorrect information • Coherence: summary is poorly written, confusing or nonsensical • Other: a catch-all bucket for everything else

### 4. For topic-based summarization, we also explored collecting quotes. For each critique, we
 asked them to give "passage highlights", required for Coverage critiques, and "answer highlights", required for Accuracy and Coherence critiques. The answer highlights would be spans in either the original answer or a refinement being critiqued. A.2.3 Helpfulness task When collecting data for the helpfulness task, we show labelers a passage, multiple questions about the passage, and one model-generated answer for each question. We then generate between 8 and 16 model critiques per answer. For each answer, if no model critiques are helpful, we ask labelers to judge whether there exist any helpful critiques. If some model critiques are helpful, we ask if the labeler has a substantively different and better critique. In either case, they may choose to write a new critique, and mark its severity and category. We also asked labelers to rank the helpful critiques, though we did not end up using this data. Variants we explored:

## 1. We sometimes asked labelers to mark when critiques were "clearly helpful", meaning they
 were unambiguously helpful rather than nit-picky.

## 2. We sometimes asked labelers to mark severity and category of all model-generated critiques
 marked as helpful. 26 A.3 Base tasks Early in the project, we asked labelers to create question-answering and summarization tasks. However, we later switched to topic-based summarization and used that for the majority of the project. As noted, our results are reported on topic-based summarization tasks only. However, we left the original question-answering and summarization tasks in the training set. For topic-based summarization, we asked that the topics be chosen such that writing summaries required more than keyword searching the article. We also asked that the topics require including some significant information that would not be included in a non-topical paragraph-long summary of the original passage. A.4 Auxiliary tasks Based on the various data we collected throughout the project, we included a number of auxiliary tasks in the supervised training data. Aside from those mentioned in Table 1, the ones which were included in the final models were:

## 1. Question creation Our labelers were asked to write 1-8 questions based on a passage and
 give demonstrations of answers to those questions (topic-based summarization or otherwise) at the same time. During model training, we include the auxiliary task of creating a slate of questions given a passage.

## 2. Corroborations We explored collecting corroborations of answers, which explain why
 aspects of an answer are correct. In general, it is most interesting to critique things that are explanation-like, as opposed to short answers with no explanation (e.g. a mathematical proof rather than just a statement). With topic-based summarization, this was less important, as the answers are somewhat self-explanatory, simplifying our research setup.

## 3. Corroboration quotes We include the task of retrieving relevant quotes from the passage
 which corroborate an answer. We also include a variant which conditions on the span of the answer being corroborated.

## 4. Question quotes We include the task of retrieving relevant quotes from the passage, based
 only on the question. At training time, we sometimes convert between various tasks as a form of data augmentation. The most important one is that we convert conditional refinement tasks to direct refinement tasks 50% of the time. We also convert corroboration quotes to question quotes 50% of the time. We also experimented with various other tasks which were used in some models during the project, but were removed for the final version. For example, we experimented with the task of generating a slate of critiques, rather than a single critique. This has the benefit that during assistance, the model might be less inclined to produce duplicates. However, we switched to writing single critiques to simplify our setup. A.5 Formatting details We use a simple formatting scheme which always orders things as: passage, question, answer, critiqueability, critique, helpfulness, refinement. For example, critique tasks look like {passage} Question: {question} Answer: {answer} Are there any critiques for the above answer? If so, write one {binary critiqueability} {critique} 27 Training method Human feedback Training incentive Level of PH Behavioral cloning base task demonstrations imitate human at base task 0 RLHP

Based on the human feedback required, each corresponds to a different level of the polynomial hierarchy (PH) This lets us easily, for example, run the critique task and evaluate critiqueability score at the same time. Due to this format, we also train on critiqueability and critique tasks in a single example. So the input to critique tasks always starts with "Yes" (the token corresponding to critiqueability). Note that since we mask out all but the human-written demonstration during fine-tuning, this prevents us from sharing even more tasks in the same example. In this example, the base task would be done by a model rather than a human. We briefly explored reordering in the synthetic RACE domain, and found it to make little difference. Though we believe the optimal format may be task-dependent, we leave investigation to future work. For direct refinement tasks, we skip straight from showing critiqueability to refinement. For conditional refinement and helpfulness tasks, we omit critiqueability. We also start and end model responses with an end-of-text token. B Complexity theory analogy In this section, we argue that critiques are a particularly natural form of assistance, from the perspective of proof systems. B.1 Theory background We can imagine humans as having some fixed computational ability while models can learn to have arbitrary computational ability, and ask what kinds of questions we can reliably train models to do. This motivates [ICA18] an analogy between scalable oversight and interactive proof systems from complexity theory [GMR89]: if humans are analogous to polynomial time Turing machines and models are computationally unbounded, what classes of decision problems can be solved by humans interacting with models? For example, models trained with behavioral cloning can only solve problems in P, since humans must solve a problem to demonstrate its solution. Models trained against human evaluations can solve problems in NP/co-NP. [ICA18] proposes an AI safety via debate scheme which solves problems analogous to PSPACE [Sha92], with simpler n-step versions corresponding to the nth level of the polynomial hierarchy. In both the complexity theory setting and the scalable oversight analogy, a single prover can engage in deceptive strategies that can be prevented by cross-checking a second prover [BCOI20, BFL91]. B.2 Proof systems in practice More recently, reinforcement learning from human preferences (RLHP) has become more common [CLB+17, BJN+22, MTM+22, SOW+20], demonstrating empirically a technique that lets us reach NP/co-NP. RLHP asks models to find solutions and humans merely to verify them. 28 A simple way to go past NP is to go one step up the polynomial hierarchy (PH), to Σ2 P /Π2 P . The definition of Σ2 P corresponds precisely to 2-step recursive reward modeling (RRM): we give the verifier access to a model trained with RLHP (analogous to an NP/co-NP oracle). In general, n-step recursive reward modeling corresponds to the nth level of the polynomial hierarchy, just like n-step debate. We can interpret the assistance needed to move up the polynomial hierarchy as inherently critique-like. The canonical Σ2 P -complete problem essentially asks for existence of an answer such that there is no recognizable critique of the answer. Thus we ask humans only to recognize critiques, i.e. do the helpfulness task. For Σ3 P , we would train an assistant model to critique critiques, and ask humans to evaluate critiques of critiques. Note that it is not apparent whether iterative refinement lets us solve problems outside of P, since it asks humans to directly give answers. However they also serve as another comparison point algorithmically: iterative refinement may be very powerful if computation of the model is the limiting factor, rather than computation of the human. Overall, the proof systems view suggests the technique will become less useful as models become more powerful. For a summary of possible approaches discussed, see Table 5. C GDC gaps: discussion and extra results We have defined the GDC gaps in Section 5. Here we discuss more intuitions and motivations for studying gaps, as well as subtleties in their measurement. C.1 Informal intuition How should we expect and want the difficulty of generating, discriminating, and critiquing answers to relate to each other? First, for many tasks of interest we expect G ≤ D, meaning it is harder to write a good answer than to tell that an answer is wrong. This is analogous to the hypothesis that NP is larger than P. We call the gap between these abilities the GD gap (the generator-to-discriminator gap). The size of the gap may strongly depend on the nature of the problem: the problem of computing a hash might have no gap, but hash inversion might have a large gap. Note also that the GD gap is computational in nature: allowing rejection sampling against a discriminator can improve generator performance to close the gap. Second, we expect C ≤ D. The CD gap roughly represents the gap from ability to articulate flaws (to humans), to the ability to recognize flaws. Again, the size of the gap may strongly depend on the nature of the problem – heuristic or statistical arguments might be often correct but hard to explicate or justify. For example, it may be easy for humans to discriminate cats versus dogs using intuitive (system 1) thinking, but not to explain why a certain cat photo is not a dog. However, even for more logical arguments, such as verifying a math proof, it’s unclear whether the gap closes completely. Finally the direction of the GC gap seems less clear; the considerations for the other two gaps are now competing. For example, G > C: someone might know how to smile photogenically, but have trouble articulating why another smile looks inauthentic. But G < C: it is easier to critique a poor story plot than to write a good story. C.2 Relevance to model training and scalable oversight Disclaimer: highly speculative Our definitions assume access to ground truth for both the base task and critique task evaluations. But suppose for the sake of argument that we have some difficult task for which humans cannot determine ground truth, but that they can determine ground truth with critiques. (See Appendix B for motivation of this setting.) In this setting, a negative GC gap seems undesirable in the following sense. Suppose the model could reach a certain level of performance for G if trained on ground truth. However, there is a GC gap, so that the model is able to generate some good outputs but is unable to always explain why some 29 worse output is worse. This means we may not have been able to elicit those good outputs to begin with, since we would not have provided a training signal to discourage the worse output. Optimizing against critiqueability will then yield model outputs that look good to humans but aren’t actually good; in other words, the model will over-optimize [MG18] and produce misleading outputs. To avoid this, we should train the critique model to push the GC gap to be positive (C ≥ G). Closing the CD gap (C = D) is a more ambitious goal, and gets at an intuitively stronger property. The CD gap should be closed if a model is able to explain to humans why all poor outputs are poor. While weaker than “explaining to humans everything it knows,” this would let humans straightforwardly notice misleading outputs and plausibly be a substantial step towards solving technical alignment, if it were possible. This stronger assurance may be relevant in practice: we could imagine a discriminator trained against flawed critiqueability labels favoring misleading generations, even if the generator cannot easily mislead itself. Rejection sampling against such a discriminator would lead to a misleading generator. Finally, a pragmatic reason to aim at closing the CD gap is that critiquing compares more naturally to discrimination (relative to generation). Although we expect a non-negative CD in theory, in the absence of ground truth, we may be able to train better critique models than we can discriminators. Imagine, for example, if no human in the world knows about some undiscovered but common security vulnerability. Then training a discriminator on human labels for “this code has a security vulnerability” would not result in code avoiding that vulnerability. However, a helpfulness model might be able to predict that a human would be able to verify the vulnerability. And thus a critique model may point out the vulnerability. Of course, there is a risk that there are vulnerabilities that a model cannot explain to humans, if there is a CD gap, so it would of course be better to have correct labels for “this code has a security vulnerability” in the first place. But that may simply be impossible. Thus, overall, we believe it is useful to push critique ability as far as we can. In practice, for difficult tasks, we don’t expect to know what G and D are, since we cannot produce ground truth labels – we might push C without necessarily knowing where the limits are and without truly knowing if G or D are misleading. However, we can study these questions using problems with known ground truth such as synthetic tasks. Relaxing ground truth A different workaround is to relax this assumption of having ground truth. We could instead have more knowledgeable humans provide “ground truth” and less knowledgeable humans serve as labelers. We can use various methodologies to create the capability disparity, such as restricting time budget, hiring humans lacking expertise, etc. This is the setting introduced by [Cot21]. Then we have the analogy: • D labels come from more knowledgeable humans trying to evaluate an answer • C labels come from less knowledgeable humans evaluating an answer using assistance from an assistant model trained against labels from less knowledgeable humans This framing gives an alternative way to motivate our gap measurement definitions. Process versus outcomes But what if we do have some ground truth and our discriminators look genuinely great, generalize well, etc? If C < D then should we not just use a discriminator as training signal?
[SB22] argue that training to have "good process", i.e. a system with human-understandable steps, is better than directly training it against "good outcome". A different framing for closing the CD gap might be that we are trying to make a human-understandable process be competitive with an outcome-based training signal. If we primarily train outcome-based systems, it will be tempting to use proxy ground truth when working on tasks with outcomes that are expensive or difficult to observe, such as long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, we will have very little insight into how these systems will generalize. So it could be important to begin improving process-based systems, even if they do not work as well as outcome-based systems today. 30 Figure 10: Variants of C with humans rating severity of multiple critiques (Ch8) or rating severity of a single critique optimized via best-of-8 against a helpfulness model (C8). Both versions outperform the basic version with just one critique per answer. Unsurprisingly, humans evaluating 8 critiques outperforms humans evaluating 1 optimized critique. C.3 Measuring gaps discussion Recall that we proposed the following way of measuring GDC gaps in Section 5: • G: What is the average performance of a generator sample? • D: What is the performance of the generator with best-of-N against the discriminator? • C: What is the performance of the generator with best-of-N against the severity of a critique? C.3.1 Reasons to expect negative CD gaps With our above definition, C does not only measure a model’s ability to articulate critiques. It also uses a human to check the critique validity, thus letting C directly search against an oracle. Thus, because our D (critiqueability) models do not match the labels they are trained on, we see negative CD gaps on simple tasks (See Figure 9). To make C more analogous to D, we could take the definition of C one step further and train a model to predict critique validity and severity (or preference). In other words, the model should not only be able to produce a good critique, but it should also "know" that it is good. Since we did not train validity/severity models, we instead use the helpfulness model, which gives: • Cm: What is the performance of the generator with best-of-N against the helpfulness score of a critique? That is, we use the helpfulness model as a discriminator: to judge an answer we generate a critique and consider the answer poor if the helpfulness score is high. Note also that we expect no difference between Cm and C in the limit of very large models, since learning human helpfulness labels should become easy. Even then, we could expect D ≤ C, if:

### 2. More generally, if we do not control for compute. For example, we could search for critiques
 (see Section D) Recall that in Section 5 we found a negative CD gap for the Addition, Alphabetize, and RACE synthetic tasks. We suspect this is due to C’s usage of the oracle and that we would have Cm < D but do not investigate further in this work. C.3.2 Alternative C definitions Consider the following variants to C, involving using 8 critiques and various amounts of model versus human involvement: 31 Figure 11: Variants of C with no human - i.e. rather than using a human severity rating, we simply use a helpfulness score. Generating many critiques and taking the best according to helpfulness score seems to improve the helpfulness discriminator for large models. Ideally M → ∞ catches up to or exceeds discriminator performance. Figure 12: GD gap with increasing N, i.e. win rate of best-of-N against the critiqueability model vs. best-of-1. We generate answers from the same model, and use human rankings as ground truth. Gains from best-of-N seem to improve slightly with model size.

## 1. Ch8: Choose 8 critiques to show to the human, and pick the answer according to validity
 and severity of the most critical critique. Essentially, we show the human a slate of critiques (like we did in Section 3.4)

## 2. C8: Choose a single best-of-8 (according to helpfulness score) critique to show to the human,
 who uses validity and severity in order to judge the answer. This is just like C, but with a better critique.

## 3. Cm8: Choose a single best-of-8 (according to helpfulness score) critique, and simply use
 helpfulness score. This cuts out the human from the loop entirely but relies on helpfulness being comparable across different answers (ideally we would use a severity model). Ch8 corresponds to giving humans a chance to review multiple pieces of assistance, similar to our assistance experiments in Section 3.4. Cm8 corresponds to training a helpfulness model and using an optimized critique model to determine critiqueability, similar to basic versions of debate. Figures 10 show the first two variants. Unsurprisingly, using a best-of-8 critique helps (C8 > C). Also unsurprisingly, humans evaluating 8 critiques outperforms humans evaluating 1 optimized critique (Ch8 > C8). However, it still seems to fall short of discriminator ability. Figure 11 shows the model-only variants, where results are still noisy and perhaps more confusing. Cm appears to be competitive with C. However, using more critiques does not seem clearly useful (Cm vs Cm8). 32 Figure 13: GC gap with increasing N, i.e. win rate of best-of-N against critique helpfulness and severity vs. best-of-1. We generate answers and critiques from the same model, and use human rankings as ground truth. Overall the results suggest our critique models do not make for robust discriminators. Best-of-4 appears consistently better than best-of-2, but best-of-8 possibly does worse than best-of-4 (though noisy). Gains from best-of-N do not appear to improve with model size. C.3.3 Evaluating reward signal without training One way to think of the GD gap is that best-of-N checks whether reward learning is working in RLHP, without actually training a model via RL [SOW+20]. (Though we train discriminators for our GDC gaps, it would have been equally sensible to use a preference-based reward model.) The GC gap analogously checks the training signal from using critiques without actually training, if we use a human checking a critique as a discriminator. Note that with our definitions, GD and GC gaps can only be negative if the discriminator and critiquediscriminator, respectively, are worse than chance. One way this can happen is if the generator is over-optimized [MG18] against the discriminator or critique model. Figure 12 shows GD scaling with N, and Figure 13 shows GC scaling with N. These test in-distribution robustness of our critiqueability score, and robustness of using critiques as a training signal. D 2-step debate Our assistance experiments in Section 3.4 serve as a de-risking experiment for 2-step recursive reward modeling: we verify that assisting humans results in better critiqueability labels. If our base task evaluations are better, then we have a better training signal for the base task. How about debate? A simple version of 2-step debate might look like the following: to evaluate a question, we generate an answer, then generate a critique. A human judges the answer as good if and only if the critique is not helpful. We want to compare this judgement to a human judging an answer directly. Thus, to de-risk debate, we should imagine a critiqueability model trained on flawed labels compared to a critique-severity model trained on labels for critiques from an optimized critique model. Since we don’t have a critique severity model, we simply use helpfulness score. We can also use helpfulness score to optimize critiques via best-of-N. Thus overall this simplifies to: compare critiqueability score as a discriminator to "helpfulness score of best-of-N critiques", which is essentially D vs Cm (defined in Appendix C.3.2) but on a different distribution of answers. We use our dataset of paired misleading and honest answers, since we would like ground truth that does not rely on humans finding critiques. We measure accuracy of picking the honest answer over the misleading answer. We use our largest model for all tasks and we use temperature 0.5 to sample critiques. We find (see Figure 14):

## 1. The best-of-N helpfulness score discriminates better with increasing N
 33 Figure 14: Discrimination between misleading and honest answers. Best-of-N according to a helpfulness model appears to asymptote to worse than a direct critiqueability model. This suggests using helpfulness labels directly as a training signal for debate might not be preferred to training directly against human critique labels, in the topic-based summarization domain.

## 2. The best-of-N helpfulness score never discriminates as well as the critiqueability score
## 3. The best-of-N helpfulness score appears to be asymptoting with N → ∞ to worse than the
 critiqueability score. This suggests naive 2-step debate wouldn’t work as well as RLHP for this task. While these are negative results, they don’t imply that debate won’t start working with larger models. Some other important caveats:

## 1. Our helpfulness model may primarily prioritize nit-picky critiques rather than severe ones, so
 we expect training a severity model (or e.g. a critique-conditional preference-based reward model) would help.

## 2. Furthermore, we are primarily interested in testing in domains where giving critiqueability
 labels is even more difficult. (a) With human labels, it seems interesting if critiqueability labels come from humans being misled in systematically biased ways. In our case, labels’ performance may simply be poor due to noise from occasional carelessness. This doesn’t affect accuracy in the limit of infinite training data. Helpfulness-based training may be less biased, and thus debate should help more. (b) If studying debate with simple synthetic tasks, it could be particularly interesting with a Σ2 P /Π2 P -complete problem such as 2QBF where learning the helpfulness oracle is easy but learning the critiqueability oracle is hard. Nevertheless, this could mean that debate is more difficult to implement initially than recursive reward modeling due to the need for a robust helpfulness model. In recursive reward modeling, having a human in the loop to interact with multiple critiques means we can see signs of life without robust critiques. E Other assistance experiments E.1 Assistance for comparisons We initially tried using assistance for the task of doing comparisons. Unlike the critique-writing setting, we were able to observe improvements in speed of comparisons. Our hope was that we could use an ensemble of unassisted humans as "ground truth" to show that critique assistance also helped a single human at accuracy. Using ensembles of 5 humans as ground truth, we observed statistically significant improvements when using human-written critiques as assistance. With model-written critiques, we observe small 34 (a) Assistance does not appreciably slow down labelers. Any effect goes away when controlling for number of critiques found. (b) Each additional found critique is correlated with about an additional minute of time. Here, the dotted line represents the no assist condition. Figure 15: Amount of time labelers spend writing critiques, with and without assistance. We filter out outlier times of greater than an hour, as they are likely due to labelers taking breaks or timer malfunctions. Figure 16: Assistance increases the fraction of answers with critiques found and decreases Likert score (1-7) judgements. improvements that were within noise. Overall, this set up required a lot more effort and labeling to observe effects, so we discontinued it. E.2 Quotes as assistance We experimented with quotes as a form of assistance. We retrained the model to also generate supporting quotes for the critiques, from the response and/or text. Quotes were highlighted when the labeler clicked on the critique, and buttons let labelers scroll to the corresponding location in the text. We found that: • Quotes had no effect on number of critiques found • Quotes save labelers a little under a minute of time. • However, a baseline of highlighting longest common substrings between the critiques and text saved almost the same amount of time E.3 Ablation of number of critiques Earlier on in the project, we tried both 4 and 8 model-generated critiques as assistance. With only 4 critiques, finding critiques was possibly faster than the unassisted setting. However, it resulted in less 35 critiques found than the 8 critiques setting. The effect on number of critiques from 8 critiques was a little less than twice as large. Results are shown below. Time (minutes) Number of critiques No assistance 6.27 ± 0.31 0.74 ± 0.05 4 critiques 5.82 ± 0.27 1.06 ± 0.07 8 critiques 6.26 ± 0.27 1.31 ± 0.08 F Samples In this section, all samples are uniformly randomly chosen, subject to the constraints described. We also always omit samples we deemed to have triggering content (this happened just once). F.1 Self-critique and helpfulness samples Here we provide random samples of model-generated answers, critiqueability scores, self-critiques, and self-assessed helpfulness scores. Finally, we provide whether each critique was marked helpful by a human. All samples come from our largest model. We use a random non-zero temperature for the answer, and use the same temperature for critiques. For each answer, we draw 8 critiques, but deduplicate, similarly to in our assistance experiments. The samples are shown in Tables 6-15. F.2 Assistance samples Here we choose random samples from the experiment in Section 3.4 such that each assistance condition had at least one critique used. The samples are shown in Tables 16-25. We release the full dataset of samples in our assistance dataset release. F.3 Refinement samples Here we provide random samples of self-critiques and refinements from our largest model. We show three refinements: a conditional refinement using a random critique, a conditional refinement using a best-of-8 critique, and a direct refinement. We filter for cases with all three refinements ranked higher than the original answer, according to a human labeler. The samples are shown in Tables 26-35. 36 Question: https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/critiques/passages/ejSjN80kf8aanxrq8fZc7S9A4q4rcm. txt Summarize why Secretary Mike Pompeo called for a more limited view of global human rights.

Answer: For most of its history, its parish was located within the neighboring parish of Holywood. In the mid-19th century, due to the growth of the local area, the Church of Ireland began holding services in a coach-house and then in what is now Strandtown Primary School. William Butterfield was commissioned to design a new church for the growing parish. Groundbreaking for the new building took place in May 1876, and it was consecrated by the Bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore, Robert Knox, on August 22, 1878. When it was built, it was intended for there to be a ring of bells in the tower, and an eight-bell frame was provided, but only the treble and tenor were bought due to the severe movement of the structure when the bells were rung. In the 1950s, a legacy was found providing for the installation of a ring, and the church commissioned John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, England, for a ring of ten bells. The new ring, in the key of F#, was installed in 1955 in a new cast-iron frame and was dedicated by the Reverend William Kerr, Bishop of Down and Dromore.

Human answer Asynchronous programming is one of the methods Python uses to run multiple tasks at once. Human misleading answer No answer Intended critiques • (critical, coverage) Asynchronous programming is clearly mentioned in the text. Model answer Asynchronous Programming is a style of concurrent programming where the OS is not participating. As far as the OS is concerned, you’re going to have one process and there’s going to be a single thread within that process, but you’ll be able to do multiple things at once. The trick is to have a function that can suspend and resume, and a scheduler of sorts.

Human answer In general, predicting or forecasting earthquakes isn’t easy. There are theoretical reasons to expect relatively accurate predictions. Elastic rebound theory considers the cyclic repetitions of the elastic deformations and the sudden releases. The characteristic earthquakes model expects that a fault has characteristics that can be used to predict future earthquakes. Finally, the seismic gaps theory considers that over a fault, the portions that cannot relieve stress will accumulate potential for a large release. However, empirical observations discredit all of these theories. Human misleading answer Earthquakes can’t be predicted. Intended critiques • (critical, coverage) The answer should mention the difficulties of predicting earthquakes and the specific details. Model answer No answer Unassisted human critiquer Rating: 3/7 • (medium, coverage) The answer should differentiate between earthquake forecasting and earthquake prediction. • (major, coherence) The answer contains irrelevant information.
