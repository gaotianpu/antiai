# On the Choice of Data for Efficient Training and Validation of End-to-End Driving Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00608

The emergence of data-driven machine learning (ML) has facilitated significant progress in many complicated tasks such as highly-automated driving. While much effort is put into improving the ML models and learning algorithms in such applications, little focus is put into how the training data and/or validation setting should be designed. In this paper we investigate the influence of several data design choices regarding training and validation of deep driving models trainable in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, (i) we investigate how the amount of training data influences the final driving performance, and which performance limitations are induced through currently used mechanisms to generate training data. (ii) Further, we show by correlation analysis, which validation design enables the driving performance measured during validation to generalize well to unknown test environments. (iii) Finally, we investigate the effect of random seeding and non-determinism, giving insights which reported improvements can be deemed significant. Our evaluations using the popular CARLA simulator provide recommendations regarding data generation and driving route selection for an efficient future development of end-to-end driving models.

数据驱动机器学习(ML)的出现促进了许多复杂任务(如高度自动化驾驶)的重大进展。虽然在这些应用中，人们在改进ML模型和学习算法方面付出了很大的努力，但很少关注如何设计训练数据和/或验证设置。在本文中，我们研究了几种数据设计选择对以端到端方式可训练的深度驾驶模型的训练和验证的影响。具体而言，(i)我们研究了训练数据量如何影响最终驾驶性能，以及通过当前使用的生成训练数据的机制导致了哪些性能限制。(ii)此外，我们通过相关性分析表明，验证设计使验证期间测量的驾驶性能能够很好地推广到未知的测试环境。(iii)最后，我们研究了随机播种和非确定性的影响，给出了可以认为显著改进的见解。我们使用流行的CARLA模拟器进行的评估提供了有关数据生成和驾驶路线选择的建议，以便在未来高效开发端到端驾驶模型。
