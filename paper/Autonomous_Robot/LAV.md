# Learning from All Vehicles
向所有车辆学习 https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11934

In this paper, we present a system to train driving policies from experiences collected not just from the ego-vehicle, but all vehicles that it observes. This system uses the behaviors of other agents to create more diverse driving scenarios without collecting additional data. The main difficulty in learning from other vehicles is that there is no sensor information. We use a set of supervisory tasks to learn an intermediate representation that is invariant to the viewpoint of the controlling vehicle. This not only provides a richer signal at training time but also allows more complex reasoning during inference. Learning how all vehicles drive helps predict their behavior at test time and can avoid collisions. We evaluate this system in closed-loop driving simulations. Our system outperforms all prior methods on the public CARLA Leaderboard by a wide margin, improving driving score by 25 and route completion rate by 24 points. Our method won the 2021 CARLA Autonomous Driving challenge. Code and data are available at https://github.com/dotchen/LAV.

在这篇论文中，我们提出了一个系统来训练驾驶策略，不仅从自我车辆，而且从它观察到的所有车辆收集到的经验。该系统使用其他智能体的行为来创建更多样的驾驶场景，而无需收集额外数据。从其他车辆学习的主要困难是没有传感器信息。我们使用一组监督任务来学习对控制车辆的视点不变的中间表示。这不仅在训练时提供了更丰富的信号，还允许在推理过程中进行更复杂的推理。学习所有车辆的驾驶方式有助于预测测试时的行为，并避免碰撞。我们在闭环驾驶模拟中评估了该系统。我们的系统大大超过了公共CARLA排行榜上的所有现有方法，驾驶得分提高了25分，路线完成率提高了24分。我们的方法赢得了2021 CARLA自动驾驶挑战赛。
